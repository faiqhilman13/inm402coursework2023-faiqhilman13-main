# Session 2: Practical Exercises

1. I think what is important is how we need to be efficient in filtering which data is most important to visually display to our target audience. I completely agree with his statement, the essence of design is to be as efficient as possible in conveying an idea or message. I also agree with the second statement, as often readers have a short attention span, even scientists. So, we need to find what is most important and then give it the best visual output to capture the limited attention of readers.

2. I see how red is associated with higher energies or strong moods, therefore the areas in red I assume represent the hours in a day where the trains are having the highest frequencies or length of delays. I don't see how this scarf has anything to do with feminism though.

3. In a way it does not reconcile, visualization comes from data and all data collects something, and when you collect things you inevitably count them. Personal visualization doesn't differ much from other forms.

4. Data ink = the bar charts and the kiwi. Non-data ink = large yellow spaces which don't say anything. They may include chart-junk to evoke a sense of awe or some emotion from the readers.

5. As it is a time series, I think the lie is how the circles appear to be stacked on top of each other, make it seem like there are less migrants than there really are?
